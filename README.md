## M1_Game_tictactoe
This is a simple game of tic tac toe . Most of the games I have seen online require two players, and I wanted to try creating a game where one player plays against the computer.

## Flow Chart

## Theory of Game:

A player can choose between two symbols with his opponent, usual games
use “X”and “O”. If first player choose “X” then the second player have to
play with “O” and vice versa.


A player marks any of the 3x3 squares with his symbol (may be “X” or “O”)
and his aim is to create a straight line horizontally or vertically or diagonally
with two intensions:

a) Create a straight line before his opponent to win the game.

b) Restrict his opponent from creating a straight line first.

In case logically no one can create a straight line with his own symbol, the
game results a tie.

Hence there are only three possible results – a player wins, his opponent
(human or computer) wins or it’s a tie.

*********************************************************

If any player is able to draw three Xs or three Os in the following
combinations then that player wins. The combinations are:
 
 a) 1, 2, 3          b) 4, 5, 6
 
 c) 7, 8, 9          d) 1, 4, 7
 
 e) 2, 5, 8          f) 3, 6, 9
 
 h) 1, 5, 9          i) 3, 5, 7
